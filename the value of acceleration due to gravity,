 A ball is released from a height of Y meters. Each time it bounces on the floor, its velocity becomes halved. Write a program, which reads the value of Y and prints the total distance traversed by the ball when it touches the ground for the third time.
Assume that the value of acceleration due to gravity, g, is 9.8
program:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  double y, total_distance, current_height;
  printf("Enter initial height (y meters): ");
  scanf("%lf", &y);

  const double g = 9.8;

  total_distance = 0;
  current_height = y;

  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    
    double bounce_height = current_height / 2;

    total_distance += current_height + bounce_height;
    
    current_height = bounce_height;
  }
  printf("Total distance traveled: %.2f meters\n", total_distance);
  return 0;
}
