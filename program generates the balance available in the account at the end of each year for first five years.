Consider a bank that offers fixed deposit accounts with cumulative (annually) interest on the balance available in the account. Write a C program that reads the amount initially invested (called Principal amount) in an account and interest rate.
The program generates the balance available in the account at the end of each year for first five years.

program:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  double principal, interest_rate;

  printf("Enter principal amount: ");
  scanf("%lf", &principal);
  printf("Enter annual interest rate (%%): ");
  scanf("%lf", &interest_rate);

  interest_rate /= 100.0;

  for (int year = 1; year <= 5; year++) {
    principal *= (1.0 + interest_rate);
    printf("Year %d: Balance = %.2f\n", year, principal);
  }
  return 0;
}
