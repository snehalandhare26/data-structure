Write a program to enter marks of five subjects of a student and calculate total, average and percentage of all subjects.
program:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int maths, chemistry, physics, biology, history, total;
    float average, percentage;
    printf("enter the subject maths marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &maths);
    printf("enter the subject chemistry marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &chemistry);
    printf("enter the subject physics marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &physics);
    printf("enter the subject biology marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &biology);
    printf("enter the subject history marks: ");
    scanf("%d", &history);

    total = maths + chemistry + physics + biology + history;
    printf("the total marks of the five subjects is: %d\n", total);

    average = (float)(maths + chemistry + physics + biology + history) / 5;
    printf("the average marks of the 5 subjects is: %f\n", average);

    percentage = ((float)total / 500) * 100;
    printf("the percentage of the 5 subjects is: %f\n", percentage);
    return 0;
}
